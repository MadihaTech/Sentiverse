# 🌐 SentiVerse — Emotional Forecasting AI

**SentiVerse** is a human-aligned AI tool that simulates how society might *emotionally respond* to real-world headlines and events — before they happen.

This project was created for the **DDS FutureTech Challenge (2025)**, with a focus on empathy-driven design, emotional intelligence, and cognitive forecasting.

## ⚙️ How It Works

- **Input**: Any real or hypothetical news headline  
- **Output**: Forecasted emotional responses + insights from key societal stakeholders  
- **Powered By**: Groq’s ultra-fast LLMs (live), or mocked GPT-style logic (fallback)  
- **Bonus**: Cognitive alignment predictions + emotional volatility scoring

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit  
- **LLM Backend**: Groq API (live inference)  
- **Visualization**: Plotly  
- **Prototyping**: Jupyter Notebook (`Sentiverse.ipynb`)

---

## 🧪 Example Input

> **Headline:** “India launches free AI education program for every student by 2026.”

**Predicted Emotional Forecast**:
- Hope  
- Curiosity  
- Excitement  

**Stakeholder Reactions**:
- **Students**: Inspired and motivated  
- **Educators**: Preparing for curriculum expansion  
- **Policymakers**: Focus on implementation strategy

---

## ⚠️ Note on APIs

- The deployed version uses **live Groq API**  
- A fallback **mock mode** is included for testing if API limits are reached  
- GPT-style response logic is commented and ready to be swapped in if needed
