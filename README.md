# Sentiverse - Emotional Forecasting AI

**Sentiverse** is an AI concept that forecasts how people might *feel tomorrow*, based on whats's happening today.

This project was built as part of the **FutureTech Challenge (2025)** and simulates emotional futures from real-world signals like news, headlines, or major events.

## How It Works
- Input: Any news headline or event
- Output: 2-3 predicted emotional outcomes from society
- Current version uses **mock GPT response** due to API rate limits
- Real GPT integration logic is includedand ready to activate

## Tech Stack
- Google Colab
- Python
- (optional) OpenAI GPT-3.5 (currently mocked)

## Example
**Input:** "Global AI law passed to regulate large language models"

**Output:** 
- Hopeful optimism
- Cautious skepticism
- Ethical uncertainity

## Note
Due to API quota restrictions, the current demo uses mocked responses . The actual GPT-based forecasting code is included (commented out) and can be activated with a valid key.
